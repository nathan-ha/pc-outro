Usage: Download the folder and run the respective .py files.

Some notes:
- Make sure to disable hibernate for shutdown.py to work. To disable hibernate, use 'Powercfg -H OFF' using the terminal.
- Have python installed
- This probably only works on windows
- Don't remove .py files from the folder because they won't be able to find the media.
- If you want to change the picture, just replace the stuff in the media folder (keep same file names if you don't want to edit code)
- If the timing is off, then you have to change the offset in the code
